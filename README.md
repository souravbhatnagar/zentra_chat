# ZentraChat
A minimal full-stack application that demonstrates your capabilities in both front-end and back-end development, with a focus on Python (Django) and JavaScript frameworks.

## Developer Guide

### Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.1.

Switch to frontend/ directory

``` shell
cd frontend/
```

#### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

#### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

#### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

#### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
